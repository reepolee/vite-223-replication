# vite-223-replication

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/reepolee/vite-223-replication.git
cd vite-223-replication
npm i
npm run build:images
npm run dev
```

Building images is a resize process and takes some time. 

## This should be running fine with Vite 2.2.2. 

To break it, please change Vite to 
```js
"vite": "2.2.3",
```
